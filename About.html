        <h2>NDIBWAMI MUGISHO ALLIANCE</h2>
        <p>I was born in DRC, a contry where war was sprinkled and undevelopment was 
        the main consequence.
        Growing up in such cucomstances, change was the only one thing I wanted to see, live and 
        experience. I had to be bold enough in order to pursue my dream in a an everoment 
        that was telling me that I can not be someone else apart from a coward and a hounded person, in contrast, 
        it was my source of motivation and the beginning of my passion about technology.
        Many people enrish their knowledge about thechnology because it sounds cool to be called 
        software engineer or web developer but for me it an exist door from what I have only known 
        towards what I would like to see in my community.</p>
