        <h2>NDIBWAMI MUGISHO ALLIANCE</h2>
        <p>I was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 
         a country where war was widespread and underdevelopment was its main consequence. 
        Growing up in such circumstances, change became the one thing I desperately wanted to see, live, and experience. 
        I had to be bold in order to pursue my dreams in an environment that kept telling me I could never be anything more than a victim or a coward.
        Instead, that struggle became my source of motivation and the beginning of my passion for technology.
       Many people pursue technology because it sounds cool to be called a software engineer or web developer,
      but for me, it is an exit door from what I have always known, and a path toward the future I want to see in my community.</p>
